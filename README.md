# Data Structures Visualizer

Welcome to the Data Structures Visualizer! This website is designed to help users understand the internal workings of various data structures through interactive visualizations and live graphical operations. Users can input values and see how different operations are performed on data structures such as stacks, linked lists, queues, arrays, and strings. Additionally, we have integrated a C compiler for users to practice their coding skills.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Content**: Detailed explanations and visualizations for all major data structures and algorithms.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can input values and see live operations on data structures.
- **Sorting Techniques**: Visual demonstrations of various sorting algorithms.
- **"Try by Yourself" Option**: Hands-on experience with data structures like stacks, linked lists, queues, arrays, and strings.
- **Integrated C Compiler**: Practice coding directly on the website with our built-in C compiler.
